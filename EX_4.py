BONUS: on top of the ex 1, 3, 5, we decided to add bonus answer of 2

E is not reversible because it is not one-to-one correspondence and in particular is not injective function:
    For example: E(1) = 1 
                E(992) = 1

    Thus, E(x) is not reversible


claim: if the function was reversible the RSA encryption would have been very easy to crack.
